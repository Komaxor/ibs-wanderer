<p></p>This is the beginnin of the webstite and this is the time that I am giving a <b>third</b> try.
<br>
Maybe this time I will find programming interesting. So far the part of software development that really got me into it is creating new ideas and working out the details into a specification document. Then I gave it to the programmers and the magic was done.
<br>
<br>
<p>It was a <b>perfect</b> pairing, as I am an <u>idea factory</u> with tremendous quantity of daily ideas and they are people, who can focus on one specif task for longer time and their minds don't drift off. I was working out ideas the whole day, and they were working on those ideas, implementing them.
